This contract has a single state variable called _winner, which is an unsigned integer of size 256 bits. It also has two functions: play and getWinner. play
is a public function that generates a random number by hashing together
the current block timestamp, block difficulty, and the address of the
transaction sender. It then takes the modulus of this random number with
2 to get a number either 0 or 1, and sets the _winner state variable to this value. getWinner is a public view function that returns the current value of the _winner state variable. This contract could be used to implement a simple lottery game where players can call the play function to participate and then use the getWinner function to see if they won
